# TicTacToe Project

Welcome to my TicTacToe game made in Java Language ☕

## Purpose

I've worked in this project because i am trying to apply some concepts of Design Patterns!  
  
It's just an old project that i have developed in the faculty.👨‍💻
  
Im interested in made some changes in the future, so upgrades will come soon!! :)  
  
The Design Patterns applied is:

- `Facade`
- `Mediator`
  
This is a game that runs in CLI, without any GUI;
